# ESPP Sales

I sell my stock on the grant date, because it's the only way to guarantee making a heavy profit (since ESPPs offer them)
at a notable discount.  The tax ramifications are as follows:

- short-term capital gains 
- ordinary income 


## Calculating Short-Term Capital Gains

### Formula
Capital Gains = Sale proceeds - Cost Basis

Short-term vs. Long-term depends on how long you hold the asset. I always sell immediately so mine are always short-term.

## Calculating Ordinary Income

### Formula
Ordinary Income = Value on Purchase Date - Total Purchase Price

This is probably reported on your W-2, but it's difficult to be sure because it's mixed into Box 1 Wages, i.e. you have
to have a very clear knowledge of your pay to eyeball-math whether stock sale income is included.  There are a few other
ways to discern it:

1. company may send explicit confirmation.  NetApp sends out a "Statement of Taxable Income," which includes W-2 Income 
reported for each stock sale.  This was super helpful.
2. you can review your paystubs, looking for one that shows this sale/isn't just normal comp.  mine lagged the stock sale
itself by quite a bit (1.5 months) but were fairly easy to spot bc: 
    - numbers were atypical
    - source was "Disqual Disposition ESPP" (rather than just "Salary")


## Calculating "Corrected Cost Basis"

### Formula:

Corrected Cost Basis = Capital Gains + Ordinary Income

## Filing Taxes:

-> 1099-B (investment income)
-> populate date/sale proceeds/cost basis/etc
-> *** enter adjustment code B - basis reported was incorrect on Form 1099-B received ***
-> enter corrected basis from above, as "Actual cost or other basis"
-> watch your tax burden reduce and weep tears of joy!
