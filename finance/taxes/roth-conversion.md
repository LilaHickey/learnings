# Roth IRA Conversions

Roth IRA conversions are desireable if your income (>$140,000) prohibits you from contributing directly to a Roth IRA.  
Unlike Roth IRAs, traditional IRAs don't have income limits (although as income increases, the tax deduction you get 
from making a contribution drops to zero), *and* traditional IRAs can be converted/rolled into a Roth IRA<sup>[1](#whyroth)</sup>. 


__This is a taxable event__.



I funded/converted an IRA in 2021 - or rather, for the 2021 tax year - and was confused when I didn't end up 
getting the relevant tax paperwork from my financial institution. After quite a bit of googling, I discovered the issue
was tax year vs. actual year:

=> I funded my 2021 Traditional IRA contribution after 12/31/2021 (totally legit - IRS allows tax year funding up until the tax year filing deadline, e.g. 2021 contributions can be made until April 18, 2022).

=> ...I then proceeded to convert this money/move it to my Roth IRA.

=> It turns out that although the *contribution* is accounted for on a tax year basis, the *conversion* is accounted for
on a current-year basis, i.e. it will show up on my 2022 taxes. ([source][hr-link])



### Footnotes:

<a name="whyroth">1</a>: I think wanting Roth monies over Traditional is not a foregone conclusion, since it assumes 
your tax bracket is going to be higher in retirement than now, i.e. you're paying now to avoid paying more later.  That
said, I know a lot of people who avoid Roth on the grounds that they think they can figure out clever ways to reduce their
tax bracket in retirement.  This is a question I should investigate further :thinking:.
